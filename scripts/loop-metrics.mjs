/**
 * Measures the autonomous improvement loop using GitHub as the source of truth.
 *
 * We deliberately do NOT ask the agents how they did. A green agent run only means
 * "nothing crashed" - it says nothing about whether the work was any good. The only
 * honest signals are: did the owner merge it, did they close it, did they ignore it.
 *
 * Writes metrics/loop-metrics.json (full history) and LOOP-DASHBOARD.md (phone-readable).
 *
 * LOOP-DASHBOARD.md is not just a scorecard - it is the Scout's only prescribed learning
 * input. Every Scout run is told to read it and "propose more of what they approve". That
 * instruction was dead for months because the file contained no idea titles, only
 * numbers. It now carries three explicit ledgers - approved, declined, ignored - so
 * there is something in it that can actually be learned from.
 *
 * Dependency-free Node. Runs as `node scripts/loop-metrics.mjs` inside the target repo,
 * with `gh` authenticated via GH_TOKEN.

## Is the work any good?

| | |
|---|---|
| Pull requests merged | ${show(snapshot.prs_merged)}${delta("prs_merged")} |
| Pull requests rejected | ${show(snapshot.prs_rejected)}${delta("prs_rejected")} |
| **Merge rate** | **${show(snapshot.merge_rate_pct, "%")}** |
| Waiting on you right now | ${show(snapshot.prs_open_now)} |

## Is it outrunning you?

| | |
|---|---|
| Typical days to merge | ${show(snapshot.median_days_to_merge)} |
| Typical PR size (lines) | ${show(snapshot.median_pr_size_lines)} |

If PR size climbs while merge rate falls, the agents are writing more and getting it
right less. That is the failure mode to watch for.

## Loop vs. everything else

Every table above is the loop's slice only. Here is that same slice next to your own
hand-made work, so the loop never looks like the whole repo when it isn't.

| | Loop | You (hand) | Whole repo |
|---|---|---|---|
| PRs merged | ${show(loop.merged)} | ${show(human.merged)} | ${show(all.merged)} |
| PRs rejected | ${show(loop.rejected)} | ${show(human.rejected)} | ${show(all.rejected)} |
| Merge rate | ${show(loop.merge_rate_pct, "%")} | ${show(human.merge_rate_pct, "%")} | ${show(all.merge_rate_pct, "%")} |
| Typical PR size (lines) | ${show(loop.median_pr_size_lines)} | ${show(human.median_pr_size_lines)} | ${show(all.median_pr_size_lines)} |
| Typical days to merge | ${show(loop.median_days_to_merge)} | ${show(human.median_days_to_merge)} | ${show(all.median_days_to_merge)} |

## Are the ideas any good?

| | |
|---|---|
| Ideas filed (all time) | ${show(snapshot.proposals_filed)} |
| You approved | ${show(snapshot.proposals_approved)}${delta("proposals_approved")} |
| You declined | ${show(snapshot.proposals_declined)}${delta("proposals_declined")} |
| Still waiting on you | ${show(snapshot.proposals_open)} |
| Untouched for over a week | ${show(snapshot.proposals_ignored_7d)} |
| **Approval rate** | **${show(snapshot.proposal_approval_rate_pct, "%")}** |

A low approval rate means the scout is researching the wrong things. That is fixable -
it is written up in the weekly retro issue.

## Learning ledger - read this before proposing anything

*This section exists for the Scout. The three lists below are the owner's actual
revealed preferences: what they said yes to, what they said no to, and what they could not be
bothered to answer. Propose more like the first list, nothing like the second, and less
like the third.*

### ✅ Approved ideas - more like these

${bullets([...approvedIdeas].sort(byNewest), "Nothing approved yet.")}

### ❌ Declined ideas - never propose these or near-variants of them

${bullets([...declinedIdeas].sort(byNewest), "Nothing declined yet. No idea has ever been explicitly rejected, so there is no negative signal to learn from.")}

### 😴 Ignored for more than 7 days - a silent no

${bullets(ignoredIdeas, "Nothing is going stale. The queue is being triaged.")}
