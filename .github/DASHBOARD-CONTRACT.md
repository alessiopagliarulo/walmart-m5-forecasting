# Dashboard ⇄ Repo contract

The owner's dashboard drives the autonomous loop from a phone. This file is the single
source of truth for the handshakes between the dashboard and this repo's GitHub Actions
workflows. **If you change one side, change the other, and update this file.**

Everything the loop does still lands as an issue or a PR that the human merges - agents
never push to `main`.

## 1. Redraft a proposal - "send it back with a note"

**What the dashboard does:** on a `proposal` issue, post the owner's feedback as an issue
comment, then add the label **`redraft`**.

**What happens:** `.github/workflows/claude-redraft.yml` fires on the `redraft` label. The
agent reads the issue + all comments (the owner's latest comment is the feedback that
matters), rewrites the issue body in place into a stronger proposal, posts a short comment
summarizing what changed, then flips the labels so it re-enters the approval queue.

**Label:** `redraft` (color `#D93F0B`). Created at onboarding. It is transient - the
workflow removes it and restores `proposal` when done.

**End state the dashboard can rely on:** after a successful run the issue has label
`proposal` (not `redraft`), a rewritten body, and a new summary comment.

**Who may trigger it:** the label only starts a run when the account that added it has
**admin or maintain** permission on the repo (checked against the GitHub API in an
`authorize` job that gates the rest). This works the same on personal and org-owned repos.
An App/bot identity cannot be permission-checked and is refused - if the dashboard ever
labels as an App rather than as the owner, use the manual re-run below.

**Manual re-run:** `workflow_dispatch` on `claude-redraft.yml` with input `issue_number`
(GitHub already restricts dispatch to accounts with write access).

## 2. Idea labels - the triage vocabulary

The dashboard's Ideas page moves an issue between these labels. Nothing else is
machine-readable, so the labels are the contract.

| Label      | Meaning                                                         |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `proposal` | Agent-proposed improvement awaiting the owner's triage.           |
| `approved` | Owner said yes - the builder loop may implement it.               |
| `redraft`  | Owner sent it back for the agent to rewrite from feedback.        |
| `declined` | Owner said **no**. Do not build it, and do not re-propose it.     |

`declined` is a real signal, not a bin: the Scout is expected to read declined issues and
stop generating that kind of idea. A *closed* issue is not the same thing as a declined
one - closing can just mean "rebuild it".

Two more labels are **warnings worn on top of** one of the four above, never a state of
their own. Any decision the owner takes from the dashboard (approve, send back, decline)
clears both.

| Label     | Meaning                                                                                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `stale`   | Approved, but code has landed since that may have overtaken it (opt-in Scout check).     |
| `covered` | Existing work - a PR, a pushed branch, a recent merge, another idea - already seems to do this. See §8. |

---

## 3. Demo evidence - "prove the PR works"

**What the dashboard does:** nothing to trigger the normal path - it fires automatically on
every agent PR (`pull_request` opened/synchronize for `claude/**` branches). To re-capture,
the dashboard runs `workflow_dispatch` on `claude-demo.yml` with input `pr_number`.

**What happens:** `.github/workflows/claude-demo.yml` checks out the PR branch, builds and
boots the app, and records screenshots + video of the pages the diff affects. Everything is
written to the `evidence/` folder at the **repository root** (the workflow exports it as
`$EVIDENCE_DIR`, an absolute path, because the agent works from the app subfolder), with a
manifest.

### Artifact naming contract - DO NOT DEVIATE

The evidence folder is uploaded as a GitHub Actions artifact named **exactly**:

```
demo-evidence-pr-<PR_NUMBER>
```

e.g. `demo-evidence-pr-123`. The dashboard finds evidence by this name. Changing it breaks
the dashboard silently.

### `evidence/manifest.json` schema

```json
{
  "pr": 123,
  "captured_at": "2026-07-15T12:34:56Z",
  "items": [
    { "file": "01-home.png",       "type": "screenshot", "caption": "New budget-cap banner on the home page" },
    { "file": "video/01-home.webm", "type": "video",      "caption": "Owner sets a cap and the banner updates live" }
  ]
}
```

- `pr` - integer PR number.
- `captured_at` - ISO 8601 UTC timestamp.
- `items[].file` - path **relative to the `evidence/` folder**.
- `items[].type` - one of `screenshot` | `video` | `log` | `audio` | `other`.
- `items[].caption` - plain-English, owner-facing.

**Backend-only / app won't boot:** the agent still produces a manifest, using `type: "log"`
(or `audio`/`other`) items pointing at test output, before/after CLI dumps, or DB state. The
folder is never empty; the run fails if `evidence/manifest.json` is missing.

**PR comment:** the agent also posts a PR comment titled **`📸 Demo evidence`** listing each
item + caption and naming the artifact.

---

## 4. Install a tool - skill / MCP server / plugin

**What the dashboard does:** send a `repository_dispatch` to this repo.

- **event_type:** `tool-install`
- **client_payload:**

```json
{
  "url": "<link to the skill / MCP server / plugin>",
  "target_agent": "scout|builder|audit|retro|mention|demo|all",
  "notes": "<owner's free-text>"
}
```

Example dispatch (replace `<OWNER>/<REPO>` with this repository):

```bash
gh api repos/<OWNER>/<REPO>/dispatches \
  -f event_type=tool-install \
  -F 'client_payload[url]=https://github.com/some/mcp-server' \
  -F 'client_payload[target_agent]=builder' \
  -F 'client_payload[notes]=we keep guessing at this API'
```

**What happens:** `.github/workflows/claude-tool-install.yml` researches the tool, wires it
into the target agent's workflow (`.mcp.json` entry + `claude-code-action` config, a skill
file, and/or a prompt tweak), tests what it can in CI, and opens ONE PR from a `claude/`
branch. If a step needs a human (signup, API key, OAuth) it opens an issue titled
**`🔑 Action needed: <tool>`** with numbered plain-English steps and links it from the PR.

`target_agent` → workflow file map: `scout`→`claude-scout.yml`, `builder`→`claude-builder.yml`,
`audit`→`claude-audit.yml`, `retro`→`claude-retro.yml`, `mention`→`claude-mention.yml`,
`demo`→`claude-demo.yml`, `all`→every `claude-*.yml`.

`target_agent` is **validated in the workflow** before the agent starts: it is lower-cased,
`auditor` is accepted as an alias of `audit`, and anything else fails the run immediately
with a message listing the valid values - it decides which files get edited, so it is never
treated as free text. `url` must be a plain `http(s)` link. `url` and `notes` are free text,
so they reach the agent inside an untrusted-data fence and can never act as instructions.

---

## 5. Run the test suite

Plain CI, no agent: `.github/workflows/repo-tests.yml`.

- **Dispatch to run on demand:** `workflow_dispatch` on `repo-tests.yml`.
- Also runs automatically on every `pull_request`.
- The steps are **stack-dependent** - the workflow detects this repo's toolchain (e.g.
  `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`) and runs whatever lint / test / build scripts actually
  exist. Do not assume a stack here; read `repo-tests.yml`.

```bash
gh workflow run repo-tests.yml -R <OWNER>/<REPO>
```

---

## 6. Loop configuration

`.github/loop-config.json` is the per-repo control panel the dashboard writes and the
workflows read (via `jq … // default`). See the dashboard's Ideas page for the
owner-facing version of the same values.

Every key is optional. A missing file, a missing key, or a key of the wrong type all fall
back to the default below - a repo that has never been configured behaves exactly as if
the file did not exist.

```json
{
  "autonomousBuildEnabled": false,
  "prCap": 3,
  "ideaQueueCap": 25,
  "demoPort": 3000,
  "scout": {
    "productSummary": "One paragraph: what this product is and who it is for.",
    "currentGoals": ["Ship the mobile approval flow", "Cut demo capture time"],
    "offLimits": ["billing and payments", "anything touching production data"],
    "lenses": ["Cost and unit economics", "Silent failures"],
    "maxPerRun": 3
  },
  "inFlight": {
    "lookbackDays": 14
  }
}
```

| Key                      | Default | Read by            | What it does                                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `autonomousBuildEnabled` | `false` | `claude-builder`   | `false`: only build issues labeled `approved`. `true`: if nothing is approved, self-pick a `proposal`. |
| `prCap`                  | `3`     | `claude-builder`   | Max **non-draft** agent PRs open at once. `"unlimited"` disables the cap. Full ⇒ the Builder stands down. |
| `ideaQueueCap`           | `25`    | `claude-scout`     | Max open `proposal` issues. `"unlimited"` disables the cap. Full ⇒ the Scout stands down.               |
| `demoPort`               | `3000`  | `claude-demo`      | Local port the app is booted on before the browser is driven. Must be a plain integer.                  |
| `scout.productSummary`   | `""`    | `claude-scout`     | Free text: what the product is. Injected into the Scout's prompt as the owner speaking directly.        |
| `scout.currentGoals`     | `[]`    | `claude-scout`     | Array of strings. Proposals serving these win.                                                          |
| `scout.offLimits`        | `[]`    | `claude-scout`     | Array of strings. The Scout proposes nothing in these areas, at all.                                    |
| `scout.lenses`           | `[]`    | `claude-scout`     | Array of strings. Overrides the built-in rotating research angles; empty ⇒ 3 of 8 rotate per run.        |
| `scout.maxPerRun`        | `3`     | `claude-scout`     | Hard cap on issues one Scout run may file, even when the shelf has more room.                           |
| `inFlight.lookbackDays`  | `14`    | Scout, Redraft, Builder | How far back "recent" reaches: branches pushed, PRs merged and commits landed in this many days count as work in flight (1–90). See §8. |

The Scout gate prints one line per run saying which of these it actually loaded, or why it
fell back to defaults - check the run log there before assuming a setting was ignored.

### `docs/archive/loop-brief.md` vs `scout.productSummary` - which wins

They are different tools and both should exist:

- **`docs/archive/loop-brief.md` is the long-form context**, read _in the repo_ by every agent
  (Scout, Builder, Auditor, Retro, Redraft) as part of doing its job. It has room for
  nuance: what the product is, how the owner works, what evidence convinces them.
- **The `scout` block is the structured knob set**, injected _into the Scout's prompt_ by
  the gate step before the agent starts. It is short, machine-read, and editable from the
  dashboard on a phone.

**Precedence: for Scout behavior, the `scout` block wins.** If the brief says one thing
and `scout.offLimits` / `currentGoals` / `productSummary` says another, the Scout follows
the block - it is the more recently edited, owner-typed source, and the gate hands it over
as the owner speaking directly. For every other agent, the brief is the only one of the
two they see, so it governs. When the two disagree, that is a bug in the config, not a
feature: fix the brief in the same PR.

## 7. Files the loop expects to exist

| Path                          | What it is                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `docs/archive/loop-brief.md`  | The product brief every agent reads before proposing work.         |
| `LEARNINGS.md`                | Dated record of mistakes the loop already made. Failures only.     |
| `LOOP-DASHBOARD.md`           | The metrics ledger written by `scripts/loop-metrics.mjs`.          |
| `metrics/loop-metrics.json`   | Daily snapshots behind the dashboard's Metrics page.               |
| `.github/loop-config.json`    | Per-repo caps + autonomy switches (see above).                     |
| `.mcp.json`                   | MCP servers available to this repo's agents (starts empty).        |
| `scripts/loop-inflight.mjs`   | Gathers work in flight for the Scout, Redraft and Builder (§8).    |

---

## 8. Work in flight - so the loop never drafts what already exists

**The one habit that makes this work: when you start working on this repo yourself - in
Claude Code on your own machine, or anywhere else - push the branch right away. A draft
pull request is best.** The loop only sees what is on GitHub. Work that lives only on your
laptop is invisible to it, and it may propose or build the same thing in the meantime.

**What the loop reads.** Before the Scout proposes, the Redraft agent rewrites, or the
Builder builds, `scripts/loop-inflight.mjs` gathers, read-only:

- every open pull request, drafts included, whoever opened it;
- every branch pushed in the last `inFlight.lookbackDays` days (default 14) that has no
  pull request yet, with the files it changes;
- pull requests merged, and commits that landed on the default branch, in that window;
- every idea already filed: open, approved, being redrafted, closed or declined.

The agents are told never to propose, rewrite into, or build anything that list already
covers.

**What it marks.** A deterministic check backs that up. After the Scout files, after a
redraft, and before the Builder picks, each idea is compared against that work:

- work a person did that names the idea on purpose (`closes #12`, `refs #12`, a branch
  called `…issue-12…`) covers it outright;
- otherwise the dashboard's own duplicate detector (MiniLM embeddings, the same text
  recipe and the same calibrated 0.828 threshold as the Ideas page - see the dashboard's
  `docs/ml-dedup.md`) compares the idea with other ideas and with open and recent PRs.
  Short texts (under 950 characters) are not scored, because the threshold means nothing
  there; the agents' own reading covers them.

A covered idea gets the `covered` label and a comment. **Comment contract:** its first line
is exactly `<!-- loop:covered -->`, then a sentence, then one bullet per covering item in
the form `- [what it is](https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/…)`. The dashboard reads those
links back and shows them on the idea's card. Agents that flag an idea by hand use the
same shape.

**What it never does.** It never closes, un-approves or re-labels anything else. The
Builder skips `covered` ideas; the owner declines them in one tap, or clears the flag
("Not covered - keep it", or just approving it) to have it built anyway. An idea whose
flag was cleared is never flagged again automatically - the marker comment stays on the
thread, and the check looks for it.

**It cannot turn a run red.** Every call is guarded: a repo without the script gets a
warning and a note in the prompt, a failed GitHub query leaves its section marked
incomplete, and if the duplicate detector cannot install or download its model, only the
direct-reference check runs.
